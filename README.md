1. Reflect on the exercises: What aspects were intuitive? Which parts did you find challenging?

I felt like I knew pretty much how to define the const and the properties, although still not completely confident without double checking examples. But then would change it to make it reflect the new info from typecript.

2. Jot down your reflections in the README.md of your TypeScript-Basic-Exercises repository. 

I'm not sure if I'm wrting my code as simple as possible, but I'm trying to use resources and not make it too complicated.

3. Engage with your peers: Share a link to your repository in the class Slack channel. Discuss any challenges you encountered or offer assistance to peers with questions.

Posted some questions about naming the file and downloading Typescript.
